Next to the Sons of Horus, the Word Bearers were
active in many of the first pivotal battles of the Horus
Heresy. The scale of their betrayal of the Loyalist forces
at Isstvan V and Calth would reverberate across the
years and set a high water mark for the treachery of the
Warmaster. In Ultramar, the Word Bearers first laid waste
to Calth and then to dozens of other planets in the Five
Hundred Worlds in vengeance for an unforgotten slight:
Monarchia. Once a beautiful city-shrine raised in praise
of the Emperor, the Ultramarines, at the Emperor�s own
command, levelled Monarchia in an act of censure for
Lorgar�s religious zeal, which was itself contrary to the
strict tenets of the Imperial Truth.
Alongside their allied Traitor Imperial Army formations
and Titan Legions, the perfidious XVIIth ravaged Ultramar.
While their enemies fought for strategic and tactical
advantage, the Word Bearers revealed their true nature,
striking at targets of little military significance but
of high ritual and symbolic value, spreading wanton
terror and destruction. This was a calculated act to
stir the Immaterium, and gave rise to the otherworldly
forces the Word Bearers consorted with, bringing forth
the Ruinstorm.
The Priests and Diabolists of the Word Bearers would
remain at Horus� side throughout the galactic civil war.
Even when their Primarch fell from the Warmaster�s
favour they would be there to whisper in Horus� ear,
as architects of his damnation. The Word Bearers
were a curse upon the galaxy in the Age of Darkness,
spreading across the stars seeking ritual and portent or
else unleashing the Warp as part of their pact with dark
gods. Few loyal Imperial Heralds existed to oppose their
Primarch, for in seeking his �Primordial Truth� Lorgar had
long since purged his Legion of those who still worshipped
the Emperor. The first heretics of the Word Bearers would
be instrumental to the Traitor cause throughout the
Horus Heresy, and would be counted among the Legions
to assault the Throneworld.
LEGIONES ASTARTES (WORD BEARERS)
All models with this special rule are subject to the following provisions:
TRUE BELIEVERS
Amodel with this special rule may never have its Leadership Characteristic modified below a value of 6. Furthermore,
if one or more models with this special rule are part of a combat that results in a draw, then a side that includes one or
more models at the end of the Fight sub-phase with this special rule is counted as having won the combat by 1 point. If
both sides include models with this special rule then the combat remains a draw.
THE ARMS OF COLCHIS
Models with this special rule gain
access to unique Wargear options
(see The Armoury of the Word
Bearers on page 306).
PRIESTS OF FORGOTTEN GODS
Any Legion Praetor, Legion
Cataphractii Praetor or Legion
Tartaros Praetor with this special
rule may select the Burning Lore
upgrade, and any models with both
the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers)
and the Legiones Consularis special
rules gain access to the Diabolist
upgrade � see The Armoury of the
Word Bearers for details.
DISCIPLES OF LORGAR
AWarlord with this special rule
may select a Warlord Trait from the
Word Bearers Warlord Trait list.
XVIITH LEGIONES ASTARTES
WORD BEARERS
WORD BEARERS ADVANCED REACTION
This Advanced Reaction is available only to units composed entirely of models with the Legiones Astartes (Word
Bearers) special rule. Unlike Core Reactions, Advanced Reactions are activated in unique and specific circumstances,
as noted in their descriptions, and can often have game changing effects. Advanced Reactions use up points of a
Reactive player�s Reaction Allotment as normal and obey all other restrictions placed upon Reactions, unless it is
specifically noted otherwise in their description.
Glorious Martyrdom � This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player�s Shooting
phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a friendly unit under the Reactive player�s control
with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule. Once this Reaction has been declared, a single model in the
Reacting unit with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule is selected by the Reacting unit�s controlling
player � that model is removed as a casualty immediately without any ToHit or ToWound rolls being made by
the attacking unit and with no Armour Saves or Damage Mitigation rolls made by the Reactive player. This ends
the Shooting Attack, with no further rolls or Tests being made � if any of the weapons in the attacking unit would
normally inflict further Hits after causing an unsaved Wound (such as weapons with the Deflagrate special rule) or
other effects due to inflicting Hits or Unsaved Wounds (such as weapons with the Blind or Concussive (X) special
rules) then these additional Hits or effects are ignored and have no effect. Any attacks made with weapons with
the Ordnance or Destroyer types or the Blast or Template special rules ignore the effect of this Reaction and are
resolved as normal.
WORD BEARERS WARLORD TRAITS
AWarlord with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule may select a Warlord Trait from among those listed
below instead of selecting one of the Core Warlord Traits.
Enslaved by Darkness (Traitor only)
Among those that accepted the favour of Chaos into their
flesh, there were those who conquered the corruption and
became more than human and those that did not. This
warrior is among the unfortunate majority that found
themselves subsumed and overcome by the other � the
Daemon. Now a fleshly puppet controlled by the vicious
intelligence from the realm of the ?ther, the warrior continues
in service to the Word Bearers as a servant of Erebus and a
gleeful participant in the destruction of the Imperium.
This Warlord Trait may only be selected by a model with
the Traitor Allegiance and the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.
A Warlord with this Trait modifies his Strength and
Toughness by a value determined by the current Game
Turn: +1 on Game Turns 1, 2 & 3 , no modifier on turns
4 & 5, and -1 on Game Turns 6+. When targeted by any
weapon or special rule that targets the Daemon Unit
Type, this Warlord is counted as though it had that Unit
Type. In addition, an army whose Warlord has this Trait
may make an additional Reaction during the opposing
player�s Movement phase as long as the Warlord has not
been removed as a casualty.
Unswerving Devotion
The Word Bearers had always been renowned for one trait
above all others, their devotion to those that led them � first
to the Emperor, then to Lorgar and finally to darker, less
benevolent masters. On the field of battle their leaders evoked
a loyalty far stronger than that found among the other
Legions, and this warrior is no exception � for where he leads
his warriors follow without hesitation, regardless of the price
their loyalty will demand from them.
Any units that include at least one model with the
Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule and have
at least one model within 6" of a Warlord with this Trait
(including the Warlord himself and any unit he has joined)
automatically pass the first failed Morale check or Pinning
test they are called upon to make each turn. In addition,
an army whose Warlord has this Trait may make an
additional Reaction during the opposing player�s Shooting
phase as long as the Warlord has not been removed as
a casualty.
Iconoclast
Once, the Word Bearers were devoted to the destruction of
the symbols, marks and leaders of other creeds and religions,
the literal destruction of fear and superstition. This duty had
once been at the heart of the Emperor�s Great Crusade, but
over time fell out of favour with Lorgar and the new leaders
of the Legion. Yet, some of the Word Bearers still remember
the old days of the Legion and continue the traditions of the
Iconoclast, whether for the simple joy of destruction or the
hope of redemption for their Legion.
AWarlord with this Trait, and any unit he has joined,
gain a bonus of +1 Attack when locked in combat with
an enemy unit that includes at least one model with the
Independent Character special rule, a Legion vexilla or
a Legion standard. When making a Shooting Attack or
Melee Attack targeting a Fortification, Building or other
Terrain piece with a Toughness Characteristic, they gain
a bonus of +2 to their Strength or the Strength of any
weapons used. In addition, an army whose Warlord has
this Trait may make an additional Reaction during the
opposing player�s Assault phase as long as the Warlord has
not been removed as a casualty.
WORD BEARERS RITES OF WAR
A Detachment which has the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) Faction may make use of the following Rites of War as
long as it includes at least one model with the Master of the Legion special rule:
RITE OF WAR: THE DARK BRETHREN
Before the canker of corruption took root within the Word
Bearers Legion, it was renowned for the cohesion and selfless
sacrifice with which it fought in the Emperor�s name. After
it came to the worship of older and more nightmarish gods,
parts of the Legion took to enacting horrific rites on the eve
of battle to curry favour from the Warp. Such warbands soon
became shadowed with the foulest and most unnatural evil,
often paying with the blood and souls of their own brethren to
appease their new masters.
Effects
� At the start of the battle, after both sides have deployed
their entire army, excepting only those units deploying
by means of the Infiltrate special rule, but before the
start of the first turn, one unit in the enemy army that
has been deployed onto the battlefieldmust be selected
as the Sacrifice by the player of the Detachment using
this Rite ofWar. If no enemy units are deployed on the
battlefield at that point, the controlling player of the
Detachment using this Rite ofWarmust select an enemy
unit from Reserves or otherwise off the battlefield as the
Sacrifice. If all models in the Sacrifice unit, including
any models that are assigned or have joined the unit, are
destroyed or otherwise removed as casualties then the
player controlling this Detachment gains one Favour of
the Dark Gods and another Sacrifice unit is selected from
among those enemy units deployed on the battlefield
at the end of that turn by the player of the Detachment
using this Rite ofWar. If no enemy units are deployed on
the battlefield at that point then the player that controls
the Detachment using this Rite ofWarmust select one
enemy unit that is in Reserves to be the Sacrifice.
� The controlling player of the Detachment using this
Rite of War must assign each point of Favour of the
Dark Gods to one of the units under their control as
soon as it is earned. For each point of Favour of the
Dark Gods assigned to a unit, its Strength, Movement
and Weapon Skill are increased by +1. A unit may have
no more than 3 points of Favour of the Dark Gods
assigned to it (so a unit with 2 points of Favour of the
Dark Gods would increase the Strength, Movement and
Weapon Skill of the chosen unit by +2).
Limitations
� Any one unit from theDetachment using this Rite ofWar
must inflict at least one unsavedWound orHull Point of
damage on the Sacrifice unit in each of their turns or one
of the units in the Detachment using this Rite ofWar,
selected at random, suffers Perils of theWarp.
� An army that includes a Detachment using this Rite of
War must have the Traitor Allegiance.
RITE OF WAR: LAST OF THE SERRATED SUN
The Serrated Sun Chapter of the Legiones Astartes Word
Bearers were the first sons of Lorgar to walk the Path of the
Ruinous Powers, and most of its Legionaries fell in battle
at the hands of the betrayed Raven Guard at the Isstvan V
Dropsite Massacre. Later on, the chapter�s legacy would be
passed on to the Vakrah Jal, but for a time the survivors of
the Serrated Sun formed a vengeful, dedicated and utterly
damned elite within the XVIlth Legion and maintained
the specialised drop assault doctrines in which it had once
been unequalled.
Effects
� Gal Vorbak Squads may be taken as Troops choices in a
Detachment using this Rite of War.
� All Gal Vorbak Squads in a Detachment using this Rite
of War may select Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pods as a
Dedicated Transport.
� Any unit composed entirely of models with the Infantry
Unit Type and with access to a Legion Rhino Transport
as a Dedicated Transport that is part of a Detachment
using this Rite of War may instead select a Legion Drop
Pod as a Dedicated Transport.
Limitations
� A Detachment using this Rite of War may not include
any units with a Movement Characteristic of 0 (unless
that model also has the Orbital Assault Vehicle special
rule), or any units with the Artillery Unit Sub-type.
� An army whose Primary Detachment is using this Rite
of War may not take an Allied Detachment.
� This Rite of War may not be used by an
Allied Detachment.
� An army that includes a Detachment using this Rite of
War must have the Traitor Allegiance.
THE ARMOURY OF THEWORD BEARERS
The following comprises a list of new options and Wargear available only to Detachments with the Legiones Astartes
(Word Bearers) Faction and exemplifies the nature of that Legion.
BURNING LORE
Many of the Word Bearers� finest commanders gave themselves willingly to the corruption of the Warp. They utterly forswore
their oaths and pledged themselves to new masters in exchange for a dark and terrible power.
Any Legion Praetor, Legion Cataphractii Praetor or Legion Tartaros Praetor with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers)
special rule may select the Burning Lore upgrade for +25 points. A model with the Burning Lore upgrade gains the
Corrupted and Psyker Unit Sub-types as well as the Diabolism Discipline (see the Diabolist entry).
Dark Channelling
While not all of the rank and file of the Legion were fully aware of the truth behind Lorgar�s new teachings, the vast majority
accepted the new rites they were taught and followed the precepts of this new doctrine without question.
Any unit with the Traitor Allegiance, and the Infantry or Dreadnought Unit Type as well as the Legiones Astartes (Word
Bearers) special rule may be upgraded with Dark Channelling for +25 points per unit. All models in a unit with this
upgrade gain the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.
TaintedWeapon
Once proud weapons and relics of the Great Crusade polluted by the accursed practices of the fallen Word Bearers, who took a
perverse pride in bearing the tainted relics of their former allegiance into battle against those of their kin who remained loyal.
Any model with both the Character Sub-type and the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule may exchange a
power weapon for a Tainted blade, Tainted axe or Tainted maul for +10 points each:
Weapon Range Str AP Type
Tainted blade - User 3 Melee, Rending (6+), Murderous Strike (6+)
Tainted axe - +1 2 Melee, Unwieldy, Murderous Strike (6+)
Tainted maul - +2 3 Melee, Murderous Strike (6+)
Tainted claw - 9 2 Melee, Brutal (2), Murderous Strike (5+)
Tainted talons - User 3 Melee, Rending (6+), Murderous Strike (6+)
WarpfireWeapons
The Word Bearers applied their blasphemous theories not only to their creed and bodies, but also to their weapons. The workings
of the so-called �warpfire� weapons defy all conventional wisdom, indeed they should not function at all. Yet, in battle these
weapons emit a searing burst of ?theric fire with a scream that can drive warriors to panic and dismay.
Any model with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule may exchange a plasma pistol for a Warpfire pistol for
+5 points per model; a plasma gun or plasma blaster for a Warpfire blaster for +5 points per model; or a plasma cannon or
Gravis plasma cannon for a Warpfire cannon for +5 points per model.
All weapons listed here are counted as �Plasma� weapons for those rules that affect such weapons.
Weapon Range Str AP Type
Warpfire pistol 12" 6 4 Pistol 1, Breaching (4+), Pinning
Warpfire blaster 24" 6 4 Assault 2, Breaching (4+), Pinning
Warpfire cannon 36" 6 4 Heavy 1, Blast (3"), Breaching (4+), Pinning
Boltspitters
As much twisted organic monstrosities as they are technological artefacts, these weapons vomit forth a torrent of bolt shells
propelled by a mechanism that tech-priests cannot identify.
All weapons listed here are counted as �Bolt� weapons for those rules that affect such weapons.
Weapon Range Str AP Type
Boltspitter 24" 4 5 Rapid Fire
Greater boltspitter 48" 5 4 Heavy 6, Twin-linked
The Corrupted Unit Sub-type
Though by the end of the Horus Heresy many of its participants would have felt the corrupting touch of Chaos, the Word
Bearers would be the first to accept it and the first to bear its mark into battle. At first this was a subtle thing, affecting the
temperament of the Legion�s warriors, but soon it had become a terrible and irreversible transformation. Some among the Word
Bearers became something other than their brothers, no longer enhanced humans but a terrible fusion of man and Daemon.
Models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type are subject to the following rules and restrictions:
� All models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type gain the Fear (1) special rule.
� Any Hits inflicted on a model with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type by a weapon with the Force or Psychic Focus special
rules gain the Instant Death special rule.
� Any unit composed entirely of models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type is immune to the effects of the Fear (X)
special rule, automatically passes Regroup tests and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are
Useless special rule. When a unit composed entirely of models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type fails a Morale check
it does not Fall Back as per the standard rules, but instead suffers D3 automatic Wounds with no saves or Damage
Mitigation rolls of any kind allowed.
� No model that does not also have the Corrupted Unit Sub-type or the Daemon Unit Type may join a unit that includes
one or more models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.
�Courage, honour, reason.
All these maladies of the
soul are as nothing before
the limitless power the
Primordial Annihilator
can bestow upon those
willing to embrace the
terrible truth lurking
beyond the veil of reality.�
The Crimson Apostle,
meditations on teachings
from the Book of Lorgar
DIABOLIST
A Legion Centurion, Legion Cataphractii Centurion or Legion Tartaros Centurion
with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule may be upgraded to
a Diabolist:
DIABOLIST .....................................................+25 POINTS
When the Word Bearers turned from the Imperial Truth and began to explore the powers
of the Warp, unfettered by sanity or reason, they took the first step on a dark path. By
the outbreak of the Horus Heresy, many among their number had gained a power that
allowed them to unleash the full terror of the Warp upon their foes.
Special Rules
A Diabolist gains the Corrupted and Psyker Unit Sub-type and gains the
Diabolism Discipline.
Wargear
� A Diabolist may exchange a power weapon for a force weapon at no additional
points cost.
Psychic Discipline: Diabolism
A Psyker with this Discipline gains the listed Powers, Weapon and other special rules, as well as the Aetheric
Lightning Psychic Weapon (see page 322 of theHorus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook).
A Dark and Terrible Power (Psychic Power)
At the beginning of the Horus Heresy, the Word Bearers were as children exulting in a new plaything, wielding the power of
the Warp with abandon and little understanding of the true cost it would demand of them.
When a Charge is declared for a model with this power, or for a unit that includes a model with this power, the
controlling player may choose to make a Psychic check for the model before any dice are rolled to determine
the Charge Distance of that Charge. If the Psychic check is successful then the model with this power gains the
Hammer of Wrath (3) special rule and increases both their Strength and Toughness Characteristics by +1 for the
duration of that Assault phase. If the Check is failed then the model suffers Perils of the Warp, and once that has
been resolved gains +1 to both its Strength and Toughness Characteristics until the start of the controlling player�s
next turn.
Hellfire (Psychic Weapon)
The Diabolist has no restraint when it comes to unleashing the raw power of the Warp upon the foe; such attacks unleash
terrible destruction, melting armour and spreading through the ranks of the foe almost with a mind of its own.
Weapon Range Str AP Type
Hellfire Template 7 4 Assault 1, Rending (6+), Deflagrate, Psychic Focus
Psychic Focus: Before making any ToHit rolls with this weapon, the Psyker must make a Psychic check. If the
Check is passed then the Psyker may attack as normal using the profile shown for this weapon. If the Check is
failed then the Psyker suffers Perils of the Warp, and if the model is not removed as a casualty then it may attack as
normal but may not use this weapon.
Lorgar
PRIMARCH
Lorgar Aurelian, the Golden
Son, who alone amongst
his brothers wielded the raw
power of devotion as his
preferred weapon, was the
lord of the Word Bearers
Legion. He swayed worlds
with his powerful oratory
and the sheer force of his
charisma, leading them
to the veneration of the
Emperor, who he saw as the
divine saviour of Mankind.
At the head of his Word
Bearers, Lorgar conquered,
not simply through
stratagem, overmatching
power or simple brute
violence, but by the subtle
craft of exaltation, by
inspiring his sons to feats
of arms in the name of the
Imperial Truth and swaying
whole planetary populations
through his statecraft and
vision. His Legion did not
simply batter a world into
submission, but applied force
of arms only as needed to
raise them up and render
them to freedom. But in
his literal interpretation of
the meaning of the Great
Crusade, he and his Legion
strayed from the path that
had been set out for them.
For his failings, Lorgar
received only censure from
his siblings and father. With
his beliefs shattered, anger
and resentment set Lorgar to
secretly accept new, darker
truths. Both betrayer and
betrayed, it was Lorgar and
his Legion who would set the
stage for the nightmare of
the Horus Heresy, seeking to
spread his new creed across
the galaxy.

Options

Warlord: Sire of theWord Bearers
Lorgar, though mightier than any mortal combatant, was often seen as the least
martial of his brethren. More of a statesman than a swordsman, Lorgar was a master
beyond compare with rhetoric and oratory, and wielded these tools with a deft touch.
While he could not stand in a duel against any of his brothers, there was none he
could not stir with his words.
If chosen as the army�s Warlord, Lorgar automatically has the Sire of the Word
Bearers Warlord Trait and may not select any other Warlord Trait.
Sire of the Word Bearers � All units composed entirely of models which have
the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule and which can draw line of
sight to Lorgar add +1 to the result of Charge Distance rolls made for them, and
may use Lorgar�s Leadership in all Leadership tests, Morale checks and Pinning
tests made for them. In addition, an army with Lorgar as its Warlord gains an
extra Reaction in the opposing player�s Assault phase, as long as Lorgar has not
been removed as a casualty.
The Fortress of theWord
Though less skilled with weapons than his brethren, Lorgar
had long worked to flex other muscles and bring other
weapons to bear on the battlefield. Among his brothers
he was one of the few to master the power of the ?thereal
to any degree, and though his skill was dwarfed by that
of Magnus he could still work feats that surpassed most
mortal scholars.
Lorgar gains the Psychic Disciplines Thaumaturgy and
Divination from the Core Psychic Disciplines list found
in theHorus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook (see page
322) and may not select any other Psychic Discipline.
The Power of theWord
Lorgar, ever the least physically imposing of the Primarchs,
relied on his skills as an orator and statesman more than
his skill as a strategist or warrior. When forced to take to
the front lines, he allowed his warriors and bodyguard to see
to his safety while he focussed on the morale and fervour of
his warriors.
Any Legion Command Squad, Legion Cataphractii
Command Squad or Legion Tartaros Command Squad
selected as a Retinue Squad with Lorgar as its Leader
gains the Fearless and Feel No Pain (4+) special rules. In
addition, once per battle, one friendly unit composed
entirely of models with the Infantry or Cavalry Unit
Type with at least one model within 18" of Lorgar (but
not a unit that includes Lorgar himself) may be selected
at the start of any Game Turn. The chosen unit gains
the Fearless and Feel No Pain (4+) special rules for the
duration of that Game Turn.
The Armour of theWord
Lorgar�s battle plate is a customised suit of artificer armour
based upon the Maximus pattern, incorporating a defensive
field generator and graven with ancient Colchisian sigils of
protection and Lorgar�s own words of anathema.
The Armour of the Word provides a 2+ Armour Save and
a 4+ Invulnerable Save. This Invulnerable Save increases
to a 3+ against any Wound inflicted by a weapon with
the Force or Psychic Focus special rules and Wounds
inflicted by Perils of the Warp.
Devotion
An archaic weapon whose origin lies in the lost Dark Age
of Technology, the pistol known to Lorgar as Devotion
did not fire any projectile or beam, but instead warped the
local gravitic field. The device enabled Lorgar to vastly
intensify local gravity and crush any foolish enough to defy
the Primarch.
The weapon listed here is counted as a �Graviton�
weapon for those rules that affect such weapons.

Illuminarum
This ornate sceptre-maul was fashioned for Lorgar by the
master weaponsmith Ferrus Manus in a rare display of filial
support. Perfectly balanced for Lorgar�s strength and size,
it is a formidable weapon and apocryphally seen as the
pattern on which the Chaplains� crozius was later based.
The weapon listed here is counted as a �Power� weapon
for those rules that affect such weapons.

Lorgar Transfigured
When Lorgar came to embrace what he saw as the
Primordial Truth of Chaos, he used it and its sorcerous lore
to finally unlock his full psychic potential.
If Lorgar is upgraded with this special rule, he
gains the Corrupted Unit Sub-type and replaces the
Thaumaturgy and Divination Psychic Disciplines with
the Anathemata and Diabolism Psychic Discipline (see
pages 106 and 309). In addition, an army that includes
Lorgar Transfiguredmay fill any non-Compulsory slots
in its Force Organisation chart with units from the
Ruinstorm Daemon army list � these choices are paid
for in points and occupy slots on the Force Organisation
chart as normal, but must begin the battle in Reserve
and may only enter play by means of the Breach the Veil
Psychic Power.
Gal Vorbak Squad
ELITES
The Gal Vorbak is built
upon the remnants of the
Serrated Sun Chapter of
the Word Bearers Legion,
the conquerors of the
primitive world of Cadia
who looked into the depths
of the Eye of Terror itself
and in doing so were
changed for all time.
Their psyches infiltrated
by creatures from the
darkness of the ?ther, the
survivors are named the
Gal Vorbak, or �Blessed
Sons� in the language of
Colchis, and are possessed
of strengths and abilities
far above those of other
Legiones Astartes. It is
said that each of the Gal
Vorbak was host to some
form of warp entity, itself
subservient to the greater
scheme plotted between
Warmaster Horus and the
nightmare powers beyond.
In battle, this being comes
to dominate the mind and
body of the warrior. His
already mighty form swells
as hands turn into rending
talons and jaws into
slavering, fang-filled maws
twisted beyond reason and
reality. At Isstvan V, the
Word Bearers� pact with
the horrors beyond was
sealed in a great ritual of
carnage and betrayal.

Ashen Circle Squad
ELITES
Serving alongside the
Destroyers of the Word
Bearers Legion, the Ashen
Circle was a unique
formation created for
a unique purpose: the
destruction of culture,
learning and faith. These
Space Marines were
iconoclasts, charged
beyond the battlefield
with hunting down
works of false doctrine
and those who purveyed
it, consigning both
to destruction and
eradicating flame. On the
battlefield, their task was
deemed no less important
by their Legion; seeking out
those things which gave the
foe the heart and courage
to fight: charismatic
leaders, priests, battle flags
and champions. These
they singled out, dragged
down with the hook-
blades of their axe-rakes
and destroyed with brutal
fervour, often making
plunging attacks far in
advance of their own lines
in order to do so, with no
thought as to their own
survival. On world after
world the Ashen Circle
tore down libraries and
churches, parliaments and
sepulchres; first so that the
Imperial Truth might be
set up in their place, but
later so that far darker
creeds could take root
and fester.

When a model with this special rule inflicts hits due to the Hammer of Wrath
(X) special rule, it inflicts an additional Hit (so, a model with Hammer of Wrath
(1) would inflict 2 Hits), and all Hits inflicted due to the Hammer of Wrath (X)
special rule gain a bonus of +1 to their Strength (this is cumulative with any other
modifiers that may be applied to such Hits) and are counted as �Flame� attacks for

Mhara Gal Dreadnought
ELITES
First encountered during
the Battle of Ithraca
amidst the catastrophe on
Calth, the Shadow Crusade
which ravaged Ultramar
confirmed the existence of
this twisted monster and
its kin, an enemy unlike
anything the Loyalists
had faced. In form it was
undeniably Contemptor
Dreadnought in origin,
its fire-blackened armour
running like molten wax
as its plates cracked open
to pour out blood and
choking black flames. The
bounds of reality bent
and buckled around the
machine-creature, the
ground itself seeming to
shudder, flesh blistering
and metal burning with
black empyreal fire
at its passing. Cultic
writings record it as the
�Mhara Gal� �a complex
Colchosian allegorical
phrase translated as ��that
which was blessed, but now
stands beyond the sight of
the gods� and claims this
first travesty to have been
one of the original Gal
Vorbak dismembered and
shattered, but clinging to
life after the apocalyptic
battle on Isstvan V. These
writings describe this fallen
killer as having �failed its
oath to the Eightfold path�
and being �punished with
life beyond death�.

Shroud of Dark Fire
The atomantic reactor which once powered the Mhara Gal has since twisted and warped to become a thing of ravaging
darkness, burning with coal-black fire from the depths of the Empyrean. Such is the baleful power of this force, it shrouds
the Mhara Gal Dreadnought in a guttering conflagration that leaks from the rends in its armour and belches from the
ventilation stacks on its back, waxing as the nightmarish war machine kills, and waning to shadowed embers when it is at
rest. Even the solar heat of plasma fire is muted and consumed on contact with this dark radiance, and flesh withers and
crumbles to dust.
Any Hit allocated to a model with this special rule from a Plasma, Flame, Melta or Volkite weapon has its Strength
reduced by -1. In addition, a model with this special rule gains a 5+ Invulnerable Save and should it suffer an unsaved
Wound with the Instant Death special rule is not immediately removed as a casualty, but instead loses D3 Wounds
instead of one for each unsaved Wound with the Instant Death special rule inflicted on it. If a model with this special
rule loses its last Wound or Hull Point, but before it is removed as a casualty, all models both friendly and enemy
within D6+6" suffer an automatic Hit at Strength 8 and with an AP of -.
Accursed
A baleful vortex of empyreal forces is centred upon the accursed Mhara Gal, like a moving sinkhole on the face of reality
incarnated into its twisted form, and the echoes of this tormenting force drive even its allies away from it in reeling
horror. The radiations of fear and horror that the war machine generates are particularly abhorrent to psykers and even
daemonkind, who must shun this warp abomination lest the black fire at its core consume their soul-stuff.
All models with the Daemon Unit Type and/or Psyker or Corrupted Sub-type must reduce their Toughness and
Strength by -1 while they are within 6" of a model with this special rule. Models that also have this special rule are
immune to its effects.
Zardu Layak
HQ
Zardu Layak�s true name
is now lost, but it is
recorded in his Legion�s
lore that he was once
an officer of the Ashen
Circle, a Terran by birth,
and a devout destroyer
of all that pertained to
false superstition and
errant creed. He oversaw
the burning of a hundred
temples and countless
tomes of lies in the
Emperor�s service, until
the Word Bearers� brutal
censure by the Emperor.
After their punishment
on Monarchia, Layak
was soulsick, and quickly
a fervent convert to
Erebus� and Lorgar�s new
teachings. He took the
name Zardu Layak, �Eater
of Wisdom�, but came to
be known by his Legion as
the Crimson Apostle for
his fiery raiment and the
scalding blood in which he
daily daubed his armour.
Suffused in dark powers
which he used freely to
destroy minds and bodies,
Zardu Layak walked his
bloody path accompanied
by a pair of bodyguards,
each unnaturally warped
and contorted and
possessed of great strength.
Wielding the Anakatis
blades, gifts bestowed
upon them by Layak and
weapons of unholy xenos
influence and malevolent
power, they cut a swathe
through their master�s
foes in a barely controlled
hunger for slaughter.

If chosen as the army�s Warlord, Zardu Layak automatically has The Eater of
Wisdom as his Warlord Trait and may not select any other.
The Eater of Wisdom � If Zardu Layak is the army�s Warlord, then the
controlling player may choose up to three friendly units composed entirely of
models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type from the same army as Zardu Layak
at the beginning of the battle, before any models are deployed. All models in
each of the selected units gains a bonus of +1 to its Strength and Movement
Characteristics, but must take a Leadership test at the end of each of the
controlling player�s turns. If that Test is failed the unit suffers Perils of the
Warp, while if it is not failed there is no effect that turn. In addition, an army
with Zardu Layak as its Warlord may make an additional Reaction during the
opposing player�s Assault phase as long as Zardu Layak has not been removed as
a casualty.

The Panoply of Flame
The Panoply of Flame serves both as a war banner and as a weapon to turn on Zardu Layak�s enemies, his warp gifts
allowing him to mould the unclean flame the Panoply now produces by will alone.
All models with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule within 12" of the Panoply of Flame add a +1
modifier to their score when determining victory in assaults and +1 to their Sweeping Advance rolls.
Binder of Souls
Zardu Layak gains the Psychic Discipline Soul Binding and may not select any other Psychic Discipline:
Psychic Discipline: Soul Binding
A Psyker with this Discipline gains all the listed Powers, Weapon and other special rules, as well as the Aetheric
Lightning Psychic Weapon (see page 322 of theHorus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook).
Soul Binding (Psychic Power)
Zardu Layak has long since mastered the art of shackling the will of another, binding it to his own will and turning enemies
into slaves.
When an enemy unit declares it will make a Reaction to Zardu Layak or any unit he has joined, the controlling
player may choose to have Zardu Layak immediately suffer Perils of the Warp, resolving all Wounds inflicted before
any part of the Reaction is resolved. If Zardu Layak is not removed as a Casualty then that Reaction is cancelled
(the Reactive player does not expend a point of their Reaction Allotment, and if the Reaction could only be used
a limited number of times, it is not considered to have been used in this instance) and the unit that declared the
Reaction gains no benefit and takes no action.

Check is passed then the Psyker may attack as normal using the profile shown for this weapon. If the Check is failed
then the Psyker suffers Perils of the Warp, and if the model is not removed as a casualty then it may attack as normal
but may not use this weapon.
Argel Tal
HQ
Argel Tal was among
the first to gaze into the
madness of the Eye of
Terror and in doing so
was forever damned when
that dark abyss gazed back
into him. Held as a prime
example of his Primarch�s
intentions for the future
of humanity, a symbiotic
fusion of human soul and
daemonic power, he and
his brothers in the Gal
Vorbak would go on to
play an instrumental role
in the galactic tragedy
that befell humanity. His
counsel helped Lorgar
solidify his understanding
of the effects the powers of
the Empyrean could have
on the physical form of
a Legionary, and he was
equally venerated and
envied among the ranks
of the Word Bearers as
one who stood in glorious
favour of their malicious
newfound gods. One of the
first in the XVIIth Legion
to don the crimson colour
of betrayal, Argel Tal was
present at multiple pivotal
events in the Horus Heresy,
from the black sands of
Isstvan V and the Dropsite
Massacre to the far reaches
of the eastern Segmentum
and the Shadow Crusade.
The so-called Crimson
Lord was a blight upon
the Imperium who sent
uncounted Loyalist
souls screaming into the
hellspace of the Warp
with unmatched zeal
and determination.

and any Gal Vorbak unit he joins gain a 5+ Invulnerable Save and the Line

additional Reaction during the opposing player�s Assault phase as long as Argel
Tal has not been removed as a casualty.

Argel Tal takes to the battlefield borne by a pair of wings of twisted ceramite and fused bone, erupting from his armour like
some obscene growth. Haloed by these wings of darkness, the Crimson Lord descends into the midst of his foes to tear them
apart in an orgy of destruction.
At the start of the controlling player�s Movement phase, Argel Tal�s Movement Characteristic may be set to a value
of 14 for the duration of the controlling player�s turn. This allows Argel Tal to move up to 14", regardless of the
Movement Characteristic shown on his profile and gain any other benefits of a Movement Characteristic of 14
(including the bonus to Charge distance). In addition, when moving in this fashion, Argel Tal ignores terrain while
Moving and Charging, but must take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal when beginning or ending his movement in
Dangerous Terrain. On turns when this option is in use, Argel Tal may move over both friendly and enemy models
or units without penalty � but must end his movement at least 1" away from any model from another unit.
Argel Tal may still Run while using this special rule, if he would normally be able to Run, moving up to 19" and
ignoring terrain and models from other units while doing so. If Argel Tal Runs while using this special rule, he may
not make Shooting Attacks or Declare a Charge in the same turn. During a Reaction made in any Phase, a player
may not choose to use this special rule to gain any bonus to their Movement Characteristic.
High Chaplain Erebus
HQ
Erebus was the First
Chaplain of the Word
Bearers Legion and the
primary instrument of
his Primarch�s descent
into treachery. When the
Emperor chastised Lorgar
for worshipping him as
a god, the Primarch was
stricken and it was Erebus
who counselled that, if the
Emperor was not worthy
of Lorgar�s veneration,
then there were other,
older powers that were.
When the scales fell from
Lorgar�s eyes and the
true power of the Warp
was revealed to him, the
Primarch would have
declared his new-found
revelation to the entire
galaxy, but it was Erebus
again who counselled
caution. The opening
phase in his scheme
complete, Erebus set in
motion a chain of events
that led to the damnation
of Horus himself,
engineering the injury
that brought him to the
serpent priests of Davin.
In these and a thousand
other blasphemies, Erebus
is revealed as both the
master and the puppet,
the instrument of the
ruination of all that the
Emperor fought for and
the ultimate pawn of the
powers of the Warp.

Shadow Behind the Throne �When High Chaplain Erebus is the army�s
Warlord and is part of a unit composed entirely of models with any version
of the Legiones Astartes (X) special rule, no Wounds may be allocated to him,
regardless of the attacking model�s rules or effects, as long as there is another
model in the unit. If High Chaplain Erebus is Engaged in a Challenge then
this rule does not apply. However, if High Chaplain Erebus� controlling player
chooses to refuse a Challenge for a unit that includes High Chaplain Erebus
then the opposing player loses the option to stop one model from participating
in the combat. In addition, an army whose Warlord is High Chaplain Erebus
may make an additional Reaction in any one of the opposing player�s Phases,
chosen by the controlling player at the start of the battle, as long as High
Chaplain Erebus has not been removed as a casualty.

HQ
Scorned by many in his
Legion as a �half Astartes�,
Kor Phaeron was Lorgar�s
surrogate father and served
as his tutor in the ancient
ways of Colchis before the
coming of the Emperor.
By the time the XVIIth
Legion was united with its
Primarch, Kor Phaeron was
too old to undergo the full
implantation process, but
so favoured was he in the
eyes of his Primarch that
he received the most potent
of biological augments
it was possible to bestow
upon a man short of
elevation to the Legiones
Astartes, and was declared
First Captain of the Word
Bearers Legion. Along with
Erebus, Kor Phaeron has
the ear of his Primarch
and, more than any other
individual, is responsible
for Lorgar�s nature as
a seeker after the truth,
wherever that truth may
lie and whatever terrible
secrets it might reveal. Now
aging and never having
possessed the sheer potency
of a full Space Marine, the
First Captain nevertheless
exerts great influence upon
his Primarch and within
his Legion, his conviction
and zeal unfettered
and undiminished.

Warlord: Dark Oratory
If chosen as the army�s Warlord, Kor Phaeron automatically has Dark Oratory as
his Warlord Trait and may not select any other.
Dark Oratory �When Kor Phaeron is the Warlord of the army then the
controlling player can choose one of the following two options at the beginning
of each of their own turns:
� Cruel Invective � All enemy units with at least one model within 12" of Kor
Phaeron at the start of Kor Phaeron�s controlling player�s turn (before any
models are moved) must make an immediate Pinning test, and become Pinned
if the Test is failed.
� Threatening Entreaties � Kor Phaeron and the unit he has joined gain the
Fearless special rule until the start of the controlling player�s next turn, but all
models other than Kor Phaeron in the unit reduce their WS and BS by -1 until
the start of the controlling player�s next turn.
In addition, an army with Kor Phaeron as its Warlord may make an additional
Reaction during the opposing player�s Assault phase as long as Kor Phaeron has
not been removed as a casualty.
Jealous Command
Kor Phaeron was known within the Legion for his unfailing
arrogance and vindictive sense of pride. He would tolerate
none above him, save his adopted son and Primarch Lorgar.
The Primarch was the only man that Kor Phaeron would
bend the knee to � though many wondered if he did so out
of respect or so that he could manipulate the Primarch from
the arm of his throne.
If Kor Phaeron or Lorgar is not chosen as the Warlord of
an army that Kor Phaeron is part of, then his Leadership
is reduced by -1 and he gains the Hatred (Everything)
special rule. When Kor Phaeron is included in the same
army as Lorgar, both models gain +1 WS and the Hatred
(Everything) special rules while part of the same unit.
The Terminus Consolaris
Too old for transformation into a full-blooded Space
Marine when the Emperor found Lorgar on Colchis, the
Primarch nevertheless assured, through the use of gene-
craft and anti-agathics, that his foster-father would join
him on the Great Crusade as his First Captain. Before
his later transfiguration by Chaos, Kor Phaeron�s aged
physique was augmented in battle by a custom-designed
suit of Terminator armour reinforced with additional
medicae, exoskeletal and life support systems known as
the Consolaris.
The Terminus Consolaris grants a 2+ Armour Save, and
an Invulnerable Save of 3+ in the Shooting phase and 5+
in the Movement and Assault phases.

Concealed within Kor Phaeron�s regalia of office is a
