Next to the Sons of Horus, the Word Bearers were
active in many of the first pivotal battles of the Horus
Heresy. The scale of their betrayal of the Loyalist forces
at Isstvan V and Calth would reverberate across the
years and set a high water mark for the treachery of the
Warmaster. In Ultramar, the Word Bearers first laid waste
to Calth and then to dozens of other planets in the Five
Hundred Worlds in vengeance for an unforgotten slight:
Monarchia. Once a beautiful city-shrine raised in praise
of the Emperor, the Ultramarines, at the Emperor’s own
command, levelled Monarchia in an act of censure for
Lorgar’s religious zeal, which was itself contrary to the
strict tenets of the Imperial Truth.
Alongside their allied Traitor Imperial Army formations
and Titan Legions, the perfidious XVIIth ravaged Ultramar.
While their enemies fought for strategic and tactical
advantage, the Word Bearers revealed their true nature,
striking at targets of little military significance but
of high ritual and symbolic value, spreading wanton
terror and destruction. This was a calculated act to
stir the Immaterium, and gave rise to the otherworldly
forces the Word Bearers consorted with, bringing forth
the Ruinstorm.
The Priests and Diabolists of the Word Bearers would
remain at Horus’ side throughout the galactic civil war.
Even when their Primarch fell from the Warmaster’s
favour they would be there to whisper in Horus’ ear,
as architects of his damnation. The Word Bearers
were a curse upon the galaxy in the Age of Darkness,
spreading across the stars seeking ritual and portent or
else unleashing the Warp as part of their pact with dark
gods. Few loyal Imperial Heralds existed to oppose their
Primarch, for in seeking his ‘Primordial Truth’ Lorgar had
long since purged his Legion of those who still worshipped
the Emperor. The first heretics of the Word Bearers would
be instrumental to the Traitor cause throughout the
Horus Heresy, and would be counted among the Legions
to assault the Throneworld.

This Advanced Reaction is available only to units composed entirely of models with the Legiones Astartes (Word
Bearers) special rule. Unlike Core Reactions, Advanced Reactions are activated in unique and specific circumstances,
as noted in their descriptions, and can often have game changing effects. Advanced Reactions use up points of a
Reactive player’s Reaction Allotment as normal and obey all other restrictions placed upon Reactions, unless it is
specifically noted otherwise in their description.
Glorious Martyrdom – This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player’s Shooting
phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a friendly unit under the Reactive player’s control
with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule. Once this Reaction has been declared, a single model in the
Reacting unit with the Legiones Astartes (Word Bearers) special rule is selected by the Reacting unit’s controlling
player – that model is removed as a casualty immediately without any ToHit or ToWound rolls being made by
the attacking unit and with no Armour Saves or Damage Mitigation rolls made by the Reactive player. This ends
the Shooting Attack, with no further rolls or Tests being made – if any of the weapons in the attacking unit would
normally inflict further Hits after causing an unsaved Wound (such as weapons with the Deflagrate special rule) or
other effects due to inflicting Hits or Unsaved Wounds (such as weapons with the Blind or Concussive (X) special
rules) then these additional Hits or effects are ignored and have no effect. Any attacks made with weapons with
the Ordnance or Destroyer types or the Blast or Template special rules ignore the effect of this Reaction and are
resolved as normal.
